I am an engineer and Maker based in Tokyo. He has attended and exhibited his work at Maker Faire around the world. He has shared his technical insights and creative approach at the intersection of diverse cultures and technologies at Maker Faire Bay Area, Singapore, Tokyo, Ogaki, Bangkok, Shenzhen, Prague, Kyoto, Tsukuba, Manila, Rangsit, and Seoul. Whether it's xR, smartphone apps, web applications, or robotics, we create our own creations and work with a deep interest and enthusiasm for them. With the experience and knowledge gained in each of these areas, we aim to share our technology with a wider audience.
